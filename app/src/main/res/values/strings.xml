    <string name="aboutus">A grocery store or grocers shop is a retail shop that primarily sells food. A grocer is a bulk seller of food.\n
    Grocery stores also offer non-perishable foods that are packaged in bottles, boxes, and cans; some also have bakeries,
        butchers, delis, and fresh produce.\n
    Some grocery stores (especially large ones) form the centerpiece of a larger complex that includes other facilities,
        such as gas stations, which will often operate under the store's name.</string>
